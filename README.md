# HelixDNS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrwilson/helixdns.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrwilson/helixdns) [![Gobuild Download](http://gobuild.io/badge/github.com/mrwilson/helixdns/download.png)](http://gobuild.io/github.com/mrwilson/helixdns) [![Go Walker](http://gowalker.org/api/v1/badge)](https://gowalker.org/github.com/mrwilson/helixdns)

  A simple dns server to read records from etcd. See this [blog post](http://probablyfine.co.uk/2014/03/02/serving-dns-records-from-etcd/) for more information.

## Build Instructions

    go get github.com/mrwilson/helixdns
    go build -o hdns github.com/mrwilson/helixdns

## Flags

 * **port** - port to run on (defaults to 9000)
 * **etcd-address** - location of etcd instance to connect to (defaults to http://localhost:4001/)
 * **forward** - optional address of forwarding nameserver (including port - e.g. 8.8.8.8:53)

## Adding records to HelixDNS

Records are stored in etcd under `/helix/`. To add an A record from example.com to 123.123.123.123

    etcdctl set /helix/com/example/A "123.123.123.123"

Standard supported records are A, AAAA, CNAME, and PTR.

## SRV Records

  SRV records have multiple pieces of information to serve, so the values stored in etcd under `/helix/com/example/_<protocol>/_<service>/SRV` should be in the form of a list of JSON objects, as below.

    [
      {"Priority":10,"Weight":60,"Port":5060,"Target":"bigbox.example.com."},
      {"Priority":10,"Weight":20,"Port":5060,"Target":"smallbox1.example.com."},
      {"Priority":10,"Weight":10,"Port":5060,"Target":"smallbox2.example.com."},
      {"Priority":10,"Weight":10,"Port":5066,"Target":"smallbox2.example.com."},
      {"Priority":20,"Weight":0, "Port":5060,"Target":"backupbox.example.com."}
    ]
